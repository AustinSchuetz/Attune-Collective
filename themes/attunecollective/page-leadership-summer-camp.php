Summer camp was consistently the place for us where you could try new things, explore nature, relax and make new friends.  In the spirit of summer camp we are offering Attune Collective’s Leadership Summer Camp.  We want to learn with you, relax and help you discover new things about the way that teams work.  This session of camp focuses on our namesake skill, Attunement.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Attunement is defined as</strong> an individual’s capability to be so aware of their individual state, that they can adjust and adapt to the situation and behaviors around them in a seamless way and maintain that deep connection over time improving performance of the team.<br><br>Higher attunement among members of a team drives high thriving, greater belonging, and allows each individual to let their unique skills shine driving the success of the team as a whole.<strong><br><br>Because we believe attunement can bring so many powerful benefits, we’re bringing attunement skills to you via Attune Collective Leadership Camp! We’ll be riffing off of the design of summer camp to help you learn, grow, and achieve greater attunement on your teams and in your relationships. We will also be sharing ways to collect data to support your attunement goals.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>This session is not like other ‘conferences’. We have thoughtfully designed this experience so that you can both see and feel what attunement is like. Each participant will self reflect, practice, and share knowledge and experience to benefit not only their own learning but the learning of other participants. Because we’re better together.</strong></p>
                    <p>To Begin our attunement data collection, included with your registration is a self assessment which will be used to customize the experience!</p>
