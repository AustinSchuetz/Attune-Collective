                            <p>We designed a learning experience in partnership with the University of New Orleans school of music. Creating a private and custom performance by the Universities Jazz ensemble to allow the leadership team to see ‘behind the curtain’ learning how the ensemble works as a team and has structure in a performance that is ‘messy’.  This experience was supported by evidence-based academic research on teams. Fruitful learning dialogue was facilitated to bridge the experience to the business context/situations.

                            <p>Team dynamics were depersonalized by taking an outside example to examine how the team was functioning.  This external example  to learn with and from  reduced insecurity in each leader creating a psychologically safe environment and increased capacity for change and contributed to a 10th year of surpassing their goals.</p>

                            <p>Realizing the power of high quality connections, the VP noted that at the start of the day of the second workshop, the team was still focused on not having enough time given the quantity of work and deadline expectations and as they connected to each other and built the skills for teaming and connection the conversation shifted to the need to better understand each other and themselves in order to work more efficiently.  This realization helped the team find their rhythm and understand when they were and were not attuned to each other. The team’s take away was that they can and will focus on making their own moments for connection and structure self-led team development workshops to continue their growth.</p>

It is those qualities that made this experience truly remarkable and unlike any other. Angie’s ability to listen intently and sift through my thoughts and questions in order to narrow down to the true heart of a matter has in turn made me a better listener and processor in my own right as a leader. She was able to invite perspective, instill confidence and also challenge me to identify specific areas I have been able to grow and mature in significantly in just 6 months of time working together. I went into this experience not knowing what to expect and with a rather narrowed focus of what I hoped to get out of it.
