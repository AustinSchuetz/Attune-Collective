                    <p>Change Navigation relies on the continual intake of information, leveraging the collective intelligence of your organization that has been built from years of experience as a company, and in each employee in the histories and talent that they have individually.  Attuning the strategic change to this flow of collective intelligence sounds daunting...it’s not, and it will use less effort than you are currently experiencing in dealing with resistance and re-work.</p>
